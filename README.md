# Task 1
Extend the Task2MonthsEnums program. Add another enum that will describe the seasons (winter, summer, spring, fall) and indicate which season the selected month belongs to.

# Task 2* (optional)
Combine the Task1Months and Task2MonthsEnums programs so that the number of days in a month is read from the res/months.csv file but stored by Map<Month, Integer>.
